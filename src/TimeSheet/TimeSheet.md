## Time Log: 9/16-9/19

### Time spent: 
- I spent about 2 hours watching the videos but I didn't implement anything into my project for this weekend
- I spent 3-4 hours working on my project that was due on saturday working on child to parent and parent to child functions
 ### goals:
 - Get my project to display the appbar 
 - Get parent to child and vise versa to work
 - Get my site onto github pages
 - Make the site look professional

 ### problems:
 - As I ran into last week, I had problems with anything being displayed on the screen even though my function was correct. The simple answer was that I didn't have all the download files that I needed as something needed an update so I needed to implement the new file downloads.
 - I was able to get my site onto github pages after a couple failures, it took awhile for my code to be able to select the main branch or the "gh-pages" branch
 - I am still struggling with being able to show a side bar once my screen gets small enough. It works before my code was moved over to tsx

 ## Time Log: 9/19-9/21

### Time spent: 
- I spent about 2 hours watching the videos
- I spent 3-4 hours working on my project making buttons for each project that shows you information for each button you click. One of the buttons has another button that appears that uses an example useEffect()
 ### goals:
 - Projects page has good styling 
 - Use useEffect
 - Buttons display different info

 ### problems:
 - Styling using mui was very difficult for some reason. It wasn't a specific problem but it took awhile to get the butons to line up
 - I struggled because at first I wanted to do 2 onclick events but I realized in react that isn't possible

 ## Time Log: 9/21-9/23

### Time spent: 
- I spent about 1 hour watching a video about react queries
- I spent 3-4 hours working on my project adding a timer function that uses both useEffect() and useRef(). I also added some styling using css to the timer and I get a Query to work
 ### goals:
 - Timer has good styling 
 - Fix useEffect(), add css, use react.memo, and use useRef()
 - Use a simple query

 ### problems:
 - Timer moves up time really quickly and I am not sure how to fix this. There is no error so it's something I couldn't look up.
 - Cant display data using a query

 ## Time Log: 9/23-9/26

### Time spent: 
- I spent about 2 hour watching the videos about forms
- I spent 3-4 hours working on my project fixing the timer, adding useCallback, fixing the react query, using a new useRef, and adding a form
 ### goals:
 - Fix the timer
 - Fix useEffect(), add css, use react.memo, and use useRef() in a better manner
 - Fix query 
 - Add useCallBack()
 - Create a simple form using mui components.

 ### problems:
 - Finding an example to follow that would fit my portfolio.
 - Displaying my code on github pages or a third party website.
 - Form looking nice using mui (boxes too close to each other and name fields look bad. Values don't reset to default)
