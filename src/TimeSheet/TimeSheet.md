## Time Log: 9/16-9/19

### Time spent: 
- I spent about 2 hours watching the videos but I didn't implement anything into my project for this weekend
- I spent 3-4 hours working on my project that was due on saturday working on child to parent and parent to child functions
 ### goals:
 - Get my project to display the appbar 
 - Get parent to child and vise versa to work
 - Get my site onto github pages
 - Make the site look professional

 ### problems:
 - As I ran into last week, I had problems with anything being displayed on the screen even though my function was correct. The simple answer was that I didn't have all the download files that I needed as something needed an update so I needed to implement the new file downloads.
 - I was able to get my site onto github pages after a couple failures, it took awhile for my code to be able to select the main branch or the "gh-pages" branch
 - I am still struggling with being able to show a side bar once my screen gets small enough. It works before my code was moved over to tsx
